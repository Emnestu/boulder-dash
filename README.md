# Boulder Dash

A clone of the famous Boulder Dash game. Incorporates using objects to represent different types of cell on the game screen.

To run, download and compile all Java files, then launch the "BoulderDash" file.

You play as a miner named Rockford. Your goal is to collect all the diamonds in a level and move to the exit. However, you must be careful when digging, as falling rocks and diamonds can squash Rockford.
